                <p>
                    I am a Full Stack developer based in Denver, Colorado specializing in the JavaScript / TypeScript 
                    ecosystem and with an inclination toward Front End development. I have experience in both 
                    agency and product worlds working with a variety of technologies and tools to solve business needs. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of my day job, you can typically find me somewhere outside in the mountains, safely cocooned 
                    from modern city life. I am currently taking on new projects, so don't be afraid to reach out.
